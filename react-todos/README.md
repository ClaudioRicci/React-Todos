# re:infer front-end developer test repo

## Instructions

The aim of this exercise is to find and fix as many bugs as possible in this codebase. A working version of the app is available at http://reinfer-todos-working.surge.sh/ for you to see what the required behaviour should be.

None of the required changes are very big - in most cases it's just a few characters or a line or two. The aim is to make it work exactly like the version in the link (even if you think that app could be improved).

Some hints:
* The only files you should need to change are app.js, todo.js, and new-todo.js.
* It's possible that if you make major changes then the CSS will no longer work perfectly, but don't worry too much about that - this is a React test, not a CSS test.
* There are about 10 bugs in total. Even if you can't fix them all, try to at least identify what's going wrong.
* It's only supposed to take about 60-90 minutes.

Please submit your changes in a feature branch to make it easy for us to compare with the originals. A (very brief) list of the bugs you found, either in a PR comment or in a committed text file will also make it easy for us to judge how you've done.

## To run the app locally in development mode

* Clone this repo
* `yarn`
* `yarn start`
